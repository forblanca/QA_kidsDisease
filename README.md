# QA_kidsDisease
a Q&amp;A system for kids disease

* dependency:
    * python 3.6+
    * jieba
    * numpy
    * gensim

If you just want to run this system, just run the file named 'main.py'.

If you want to use your own dataset, run the file named 'train.py' first. Then run 'main.py'.(Please note the file path
)

Because of the size limit of this platform upload file, I have to split 'q_fenci' into five parts and 'q_pro' into three parts. 

Please merge these files yourself if you want to use this system.
